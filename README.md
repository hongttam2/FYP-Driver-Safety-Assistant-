# About The application

This project aims to provide an affordable safety
solution by implementing a free application, “Driver Safety Assistant.” The application
is designed to enhance road safety by mitigating drowsiness and distraction risks by
utilizing a cutting-edge eye-tracking model via Google ML Kit. The application
features a real-time camera preview with eye and head position tracking to detect
signs of fatigue (e.g., prolonged eye closures) and phone usage, issuing auditory
alerts to refocus drivers.
